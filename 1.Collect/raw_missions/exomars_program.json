  "overview": "After analyzing the provided URL, here is a 3-5 sentence overview paragraph summarizing the mission:\n\nThe Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a NASA mission operated in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Launched on March 14, 2016, the TGO is currently operational, orbiting Mars to study the planet's atmosphere. The mission aims to investigate the Martian atmosphere's composition, including trace gases such as methane, and to provide data for future Mars missions. A unique aspect of the TGO is its ability to detect and analyze the sources and sinks of these gases, helping scientists better understand the Martian environment and potential habitability.",
