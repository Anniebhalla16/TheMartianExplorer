  "overview": "The Mars Odyssey mission is a NASA spacecraft that has been orbiting Mars since 2001, led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona. The mission aims to study the Martian geology, climate, and potential habitability, with a focus on mapping the planet's surface composition, including the presence of water ice and rocks. Launched on April 7, 2001, the Odyssey has been successfully operating for over two decades, providing valuable insights into the Red Planet's history and evolution. As one of the longest-running Mars missions, the Odyssey has made significant contributions to our understanding of the Martian environment and has paved the way for future exploration.",
