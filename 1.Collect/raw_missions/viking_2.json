  "overview": "The Viking 2 mission, operated by NASA, is a historic space exploration project that launched on September 9, 1975. The mission aimed to study the Martian surface and atmosphere, with a focus on searching for signs of life and understanding the planet's geology and climate. Viking 2 consisted of an orbiter and a lander, which successfully touched down on Mars' surface on September 3, 1976, and operated for several years, providing valuable insights into the Martian environment. The Viking 2 mission was a groundbreaking endeavor that paved the way for future Mars exploration, marking a significant milestone in the search for life beyond Earth.",
