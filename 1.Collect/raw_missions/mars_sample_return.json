    "Mars Sample Return (MSR) would be NASA's and ESA’s (European Space Agency) ambitious, multi-mission campaign to bring carefully selected samples to Earth. MSR would fulfill one of the highest priority solar system exploration goals from the science community. Returned samples would revolutionize our understanding of Mars, our solar system and prepare for human explorers to the Red Planet."
