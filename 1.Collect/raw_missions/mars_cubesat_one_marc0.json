  "overview": "The Mars Cube One (MarCO) mission is a NASA project that launched on May 5, 2018, as a technology demonstration alongside the InSight lander. MarCO, also known as the Mars Cube One, is a pair of small satellites that will study Mars and test a new type of spacecraft communication system. The mission aims to relay data from the InSight lander as it enters Mars' atmosphere, providing near real-time communication with Earth. This mission is significant as it is the first time CubeSats have been used for a deep space mission, demonstrating their potential for future interplanetary communications and paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective space exploration.",
