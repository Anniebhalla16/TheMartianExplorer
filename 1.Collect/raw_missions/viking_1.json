  "overview": "The Viking 1 mission, managed by NASA, was designed to study the Martian surface and search for signs of life on the Red Planet. Launched on August 20, 1975, Viking 1 consisted of an orbiter and a lander, which touched down on Mars on July 20, 1976. The mission aimed to gather data on the Martian geology, atmosphere, and potential biosignatures, with a focus on understanding the planet's habitability. As one of the first missions to successfully land on Mars, Viking 1 paved the way for future planetary exploration, providing valuable insights into the Martian environment and its potential for supporting life.",
