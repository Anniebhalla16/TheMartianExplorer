    "NASA is participating in a mission of ESA (European Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency called Mars Express, which has been exploring the atmosphere and surface of Mars from polar orbit since arriving at the Red Planet in 2003. Initially, Mars Express also carried a small lander called Beagle 2, named for the ship in which Charles Darwin set sail to explore uncharted areas of Earth in 1831. The lander was lost on arrival in December 2003."
