  "overview": "The Mars Express mission is a European Space Agency (ESA) project, with NASA participating as a major partner, that launched on June 2, 2003. The mission aims to study the Martian environment, geology, and climate, using a range of instruments to gather data on the planet's surface, subsurface, and atmosphere. Mars Express is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Mars, including its subsurface, polar ice caps, and geological history, and has been successfully orbiting the planet for over 19 years. As one of the most successful interplanetary missions, Mars Express has greatly advanced our knowledge of the Red Planet, and its findings continue to contribute to the ongoing exploration of Mars.",
