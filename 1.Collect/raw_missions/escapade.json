  "overview": "The ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission is a NASA-funded project led by the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Colorado Boulder. Set to launch in 2024, ESCAPADE aims to study the interaction between the solar wind and Mars' magnetic field, as well as the escape of ions from the Martian atmosphere. The mission consists of two identical small satellites that will orbit Mars and gather data on the planet's plasma environment, providing valuable insights into the Martian magnetosphere and its effects on the atmosphere. By exploring Mars' unique plasma environment, ESCAPADE will help scientists better understand the planet's history, climate, and potential habitability, making it a crucial step in the ongoing exploration of the Red Planet.",
