  "overview": "The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity mission is a NASA project that aims to explore Mars and understand its habitability. Led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Curiosity rover was launched on November 26, 2011, and landed on Mars on August 6, 2012. The mission is studying the Martian geology, climate, and potential biosignatures, with a focus on determining whether Mars was or is capable of supporting life. As a unique aspect of the mission, the Curiosity rover is equipped with a suite of advanced instruments, including a rock-analyzing laser and a drill, which enable it to gather and analyze samples from the Martian surface.",
